# Core Image + CI Filters

## Guidelines

- Fast image processing and analysis

- What to look at:

  Automatic Enhancements, CIDetector

  

## Ideas

- Program with which you can set all filters for your own photos and make face detection or object detection.
- Quartz Composer



## General

### Core Image

- Highly hardware optimized image processing

### Context

- Core Image requires a Context in which the computing is done
- Allocates the necessary memory
- Compiling and running the filter kernels
- Very expensive to create

### Filter

- A filter creates a transformation of an image with set values

- The kernel is written in a subset of GLSL, the shading language of OpenGL (glslang)

  - A kernel is a convolution matrix or mask which can be applied to an image.

  - For example:

    â€‹    Identity:				  Edge detection:

    $\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&0\end{bmatrix}$            $\begin{bmatrix}0&-1&0\\-1&4&-1\\0&-1&0\end{bmatrix}$

- Filters can be chained in a row, since the output of the first filter can become the input of the second.

  - Core Image combines chained filters intelligently so that they are calculated more efficiently.
  - Core image defers the work until the finished image is requested



## Processing Images

### Loading/saving Images

### Filtering an Image

1. Create and customize a filter chain
2. Pass an image to be filtered
3. Get the completely filtered image

#### Creating an input image

- UIImage
  - High Level Way to display image data
- Image
  - ToDo SwiftUI
- CIImage
  - Is not a picture itself but has all the information to create a picture
  - Is used to apply filters with Core Image
- CGImage
  - Can only represent bitmaps
  - Is used to apply blend modes and masking

#### We need a CIImage and  for example it can be easily created with a UIImage.

```swift
let cgInputImage = CIImage(image: uiImageInput)
```

#### Passing the Image to the filter

```swift
sepiaFilter.setValue(cgInputImage, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)
```

#### Convert the resulting CIImage back to a UIImage

```swift
let uiOutputImage = UIImage(cgImage: cgOutputImage)
```



## Built-in Filters

### Display a list of all available filters

```swift
let buildInFilters = CIFilter.filterNames(inCategory: kCICategoryBuiltIn)
print(buildInFilters)
```

- 230 on iPadOS 15.1

### Initialize a CIFilter

```swift
let sepiaFilter = CIFilter(name: "CISepiaTone")
```

### Customize  Built-in Filters Parameters

- Most properties are accessible via a key-value coding (KVC)
- Display a list of all available input keys

```swift
let allSepiaInputKeys = sepiaFilter.inputKeys
print(allSepiaInputKeys)
```

- If you want to display more detailed information for each parameter, such as an explanation, the min/max/default value and more as follows:

```swift
let allSepiaAttributes = sepiaFilter.attributes
print(allSepiaAttributes)
```

- With the right key you can set a value as follows:

```swift
sepiaFilter.setValue(1.0, forKey: kCIInputIntensityKey)
```

- Unfortunately, the parameters are not type-safe and must therefore be set very carefully.
